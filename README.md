# STL DSA Data Dashboard

### To get started:
1) Install Python 3.8+ (I use [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/) to manage my python versions, but use whatever works for you and your machine)
2) Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management (if you're used to pip or another Python dependency management system feel free to use it but your mileage may vary)
3) Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/schlich/stldsa-data.git` and `cd` into the directory
4) Install your dependencies with `poetry install`
5) Activate your virtual environment with `poetry shell` (you will need to do this every time you work on the project)

That should get things up and running, reach out if you have any questions
